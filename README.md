### Installation

To install UV in Python, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install uv
```

### Running the Django Project

To run the Django project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.
   
2. Execute the following command to start the development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

3. Once the server starts successfully, you can access your Django project in a web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

4. You can now explore your Django project and start developing your application!

If you encounter any issues, make sure all dependencies are installed correctly and there are no errors in your code or configuration files.

Happy coding!
